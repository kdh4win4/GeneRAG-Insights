# 🧬 GeneRAG-Insights

## Description
**GeneRAG-Insights** is an AI-powered bioinformatics tool designed to automate the clinical interpretation of genetic variants. By leveraging **Large Language Models (LLM)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, this project bridges the gap between raw genomic data and the latest medical literature. 

It parses VCF files, retrieves relevant scientific papers from specialized databases, and generates structured clinical summaries to assist researchers in making data-driven decisions.
