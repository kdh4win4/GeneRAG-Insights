# 🧬 GeneRAG-Insights

> **Automated Clinical Interpretation of Genetic Variants using LLM & RAG**

## 📝 Description
**GeneRAG-Insights** is an AI-powered bioinformatics tool designed to automate the clinical interpretation of genetic variants. By leveraging **Large Language Models (LLM)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, this project bridges the gap between raw genomic data and the latest medical literature. It parses VCF files, retrieves relevant scientific papers from specialized databases, and generates structured clinical summaries to assist researchers in making data-driven decisions.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Genomic Data Parsing**: Efficiently extracts key variant information (Gene, Mutation type, Impact) from standard VCF files.
- **Contextual Bio-Retrieval**: Uses RAG to search and fetch relevant scientific context from medical databases (e.g., PubMed, ClinVar).
- **Automated Clinical Reporting**: Leverages LLMs to synthesize complex research data into concise, structured clinical interpretation reports.
- **Evidence-Based Insights**: Provides summaries with cited context to ensure high factual accuracy for genomic research.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Orchestration**: LangChain
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **UI**: Streamlit (Planned)
